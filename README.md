# TD-Grass

This component allows you to create fields of grass.  There are parameters to change most aspects of the look and behavior. 

To create wind and move the grass, create two tops with a width and height of the "Grass Density" parameter. Only the red channel will be used.
One top will be the X direction, one will be the Z direction. .5 is the resting state.
